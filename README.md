# JazzQuiz

## What is it?
This is a type of quiz designed to be used in face-to-face lessons, with a classroom full of computers/tablets/phones.
The teacher creates the quiz in advance - adding question bank questions from the Moodle question bank.
(This includes any question type available for Moodle)

During the lesson, the teacher starts the quiz. Students can now connect to this quiz.
Once the teacher is satisfied that all students have connected to the quiz, they can click on "Start Quiz"
Depending on the question settings the question will end automatically, or will need to be ended via the instructor's
"end question" button.

The teacher can, at a later date, go back through the results and, for each question, see exactly what answer each
student gave. Students will also be able to view their attempts.

## Please note
The original plugin, Realtime Quiz, was written by Davo Smith.
Funded by an educational innovation grant given to the Medical school,
the University of Wisconsin - Madison re-wrote the plugin to
use the question engine integration as well as a bunch of other new features.
