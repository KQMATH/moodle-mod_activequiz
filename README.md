# JazzQuiz

## What is it?
JazzQuiz is designed to be used in face-to-face lessons, with a classroom full of computers, tablets and phones.
The teacher may plan questions in advance, but can also easily improvise on the fly.
Write your question on the blackboard, and select an appropriate question type from the dropdown menu.

During the lesson, the teacher starts the quiz. Students can now connect to this quiz.
Once the teacher is satisfied that all students have connected to the quiz, they can click on **Start Quiz**
Depending on the question settings the question will end automatically, or will need to be ended via the instructor's
**End question** button.

The teacher can, at a later date, go back through the results and, for each question, see exactly what answer each
student gave.
